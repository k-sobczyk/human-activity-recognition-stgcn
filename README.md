# human-activity-recognition-stgcn
A deep learning project for human exercise classification using ST-GCN (Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks). The model processes sensor data to recognize and classify different physical exercises. Built with PyTorch, this implementation utilizes spatial-temporal patterns in body movement data to achieve accurate exercise recognition.
